Hello, world!

You successfully submitted your Bitbucket repository URL, and granted
sufficient access rights to j.noll@herts.ac.uk for me to push this file.

Congratulations!

You are now ready for the next deliverable (the research question).

CAUTION! Never, EVER delete this repository!

If you do, you will:

1.  Lose all of your project history, meaning everything you did up to
    the time you deleted the repository will be lost and it will be as
    if you never submitted anything.

    This will result in a failing grade.

2.  End up with a different URL from the one submitted for the Bitbucket
    URL assignment. This means you will not get credit for anything you
    do after you delete your old repository, because we will be looking
    for your repository at the URL you originally submitted. You are not
    allowed to re-submit your URLs after the deadline.

    This will result in a failing grade.

Git is extremely resilient, and has been used to manage hundreds of
millions of repositories, some of which (like the Linux kernel) have
tens of thousands of files and years of history. It works, full stop.

So, if you think you need to delete your repository and start over, you
are doing it wrong. Instead, figure out whatâ€™s wrong and fix it. Seek
help, from Google, Stack Exchange, and your module team.

DO NOT DELETE THIS REPOSITORY!
